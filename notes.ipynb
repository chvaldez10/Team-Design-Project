    "- If the script is going to look for more frames, then it might be better to re sample instead of changing metadata based on \"true frames\".\n",
    "  - For example, let's say we're sampling for frames [0, 1, 2, 3] but we only have frames [0, 1] because [2, 3] is corrupted and read the end of file. Then the script would sample sample for [0, 0, 1, 1] instead.\n",
